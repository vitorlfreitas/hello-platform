The Kustomization File

An overview of the content of a kustomization file.
The kustomization file is a YAML specification of a Kubernetes Resource Model (KRM) object called a Kustomization. A kustomization describes how to generate or transform other KRM objects.

Although most practical kustomization files don’t actually look this way, a kustomization.yaml file is basically four lists:

A typical layoult:
app1/
  kustomization.yaml
    | resources:
    | - ../base
    | patches:
    | - patch1.yaml
  patch1.yaml

app2/
  kustomization.yaml
    | resources:
    | - ../base
    | patches:
    | - patch2.yaml
  patch2.yaml

base/
  kustomization.yaml
    | resources:
    | - deployment.yaml
    | - configMap.yaml
  deployment.yaml
  configMap.yaml
