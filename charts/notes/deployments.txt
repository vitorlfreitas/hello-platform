Deployments

A Deployment manages a set of Pods to run an application workload, usually one that doesn't maintain state.

Create the Deployment by running the following command:

    kubectl apply -f path-to-deployment.yaml

Get all deployments to check if a deployment was created

    kubectl get deployments
